The program takes parameters from a list: First_Name, Last_Name, Degree, Employment, and Projects. Then, depending on each of those parameters, it assigns a numeric value based on what you are looking for. For example, Degree might be assigned 5 points, and each job they've had could count for 3 points. At the end, it displays each candidate and the total points they have earned.
